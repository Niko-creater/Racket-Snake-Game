## (2) Description

This project intend to create a snake game with Racket language.

## (3) Functionality

The player controls a long, thin creature, 
resembling a snake, which roams around on 
a bordered plane, picking up food (or some 
other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail 
or the edges of the playing area. Each time 
the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows 
longer, making the game increasingly 
difficult. The user controls the direction of 
the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), 
and the snake's body follows.
